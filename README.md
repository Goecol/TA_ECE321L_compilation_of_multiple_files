ECE321L ‚Äì Lab: Compilation of Multiple Files

This repository contains a lab assignment for ECE 321L ‚Äì Introduction to Software Engineering. The objective is to demonstrate how to split code into multiple files, compile them together, and understand the advantages of modular programming.

üìò Lab Objective

Learn how to organize code across multiple files.

Practice compiling and linking .c files into a single executable.

Understand the role of libraries (e.g., -lm for the math library).

Learn about include guards to prevent redefinition errors.


üìÇ Repository Contents

main.c ‚Äì Contains the main() function and program entry point.

shapes.c ‚Äì Contains helper functions for shape-related calculations.

shapes.h ‚Äì Header file with function declarations.

info.c, header1.c, header1.h, header2.c, header2.h ‚Äì Example files to study include guards and file dependencies.


üõ†Ô∏è Compilation Instructions
Compile shapes example

Linux / macOS

gcc main.c shapes.c -o main -lm
./main


Windows (MinGW or similar)

gcc main.c shapes.c -o main.exe -lm
main.exe


The -lm flag links the math library, required for functions like sqrt() or pow().

Compile include guards example

Linux / macOS

gcc info.c header1.c header2.c -o info
./info


Windows

gcc info.c header1.c header2.c -o info.exe
info.exe


üîπ How It Works: Include Guards

#ifndef SHAPES_H
Checks if SHAPES_H is already defined. If not, the code between this line and the corresponding #endif is included in compilation.

#define SHAPES_H
Defines SHAPES_H, ensuring that if the header is included again in the same file or another file, the #ifndef SHAPES_H condition evaluates to false, skipping the enclosed declarations.

#endif
Marks the end of the conditional code block started by #ifndef.


Why important:
Without include guards, multiple inclusion of the same header can lead to compilation errors due to redefinition of functions, variables, or data structures.


‚ú® Learning Outcomes

Gain hands-on experience compiling multiple source files.

Understand modular programming and how include guards prevent redefinition errors.

Learn to link external libraries and manage dependencies in multi-file projects.
